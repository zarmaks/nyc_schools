Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. 

I have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.

I have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.

1. Finding schools with the best math scores

2. Identifying the top 10 performing schools

3. Locating the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation in SAT performance
