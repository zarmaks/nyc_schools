In this project, we analyze SAT scores from NYC public schools to uncover insights into academic performance across different boroughs. Utilizing Python for data analysis, we explore patterns, identify top-performing schools, and investigate the factors contributing to test results. This README documents the methodologies and findings from the exploratory data analysis conducted on this educational dataset.
